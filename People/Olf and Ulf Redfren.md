CG male human teamsters

Hailing from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the twin Ulfen brothers used to be part of a merchant vessel that plied the waters of Lake Encarthan, but when war came the region, the boat was sunk and the two barely made it to shore alive. They signed up with Bort soon after.

These gregarious brothers like to play pranks on the other members of the caravan and their traveling companions and frequently dress alike and try to confuse people as to who is Olf and who is Ulf.
