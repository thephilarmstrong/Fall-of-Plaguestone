LN female half-orc chief

If Bort is the smiling face behind the caravan, Tamli is its overseer. As Bort’s second in command, Tamli oversees the other staff and wagons in the train, making sure that all are in good spirits and good working order respectively.

She is skilled at handling beasts of burden, but stern with the other members of the caravan. Her personal manner with outsiders and passengers are a bit brusque and awkward.

She carries a lock of hair on a leather cord around her neck that’s from her son, who she lost years ago when she fled from Belkzen. She doesn’t like to talk about it with those she doesn’t trust.

The only person she regularly confides in is Bort, although she can often be heard barking orders at the other members of the caravan.
