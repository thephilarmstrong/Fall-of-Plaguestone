LN old male elf cook

Aged even for an elf, Cooky’s real name is Talair Starlight, although only Bort knows that. To everyone else he is Cooky, the merchant caravan’s resident cook—although some call him “cocky” behind his back, owing to the fact that he only has one ear and is constantly tilting his head to one side to compensate.

Attached to the back of Cooky’s wagon is a large iron pan that can hold hot coals and even burning logs, allowing him to slow cook stew in a pot above the flames, even while travelling.

Cooky has a hard time hearing most folk, although many of the others in the caravan think he can hear just fine and chooses to ignore others when they irritate him.
