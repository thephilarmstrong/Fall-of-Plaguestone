Each of your reasons for being here is your own, although you are all linked by your love of the now destroyed inn [[The Hammer and Anvil]]. Hoping for better lives outside of [[Isger]], you've sold everything you couldn't carry and embarked out into the wider world.

Talk of outside of Isger is rare to find, but you eventually heard of [[Bort]], a dwarven trader and humanitarian who operates a unique trade route, eschewing the safer and more well trodden paths of humans. Using his ancestral knowledge of the mountains to instead cut straight through the [[Five Kings Mountains]] before arriving at [[Falcon's Hollow]] to sail down [[River Foam]] onto the [[Andoshen River]] and into the heart of [[Almas]].

Bort has gained a good reputation and modest wealth serving the settlements along this path, he has also gained a reputation for helping those in need escape [[Elidir]], especially considering recent political manouvering in [[Isger]].

It's been three days since you were smuggled out of [[Elidir]], you spent the first day and night worried you were being followed, but now there's enough ground between you an [[Elidir]], you've settled down and have begun integrating with the caravan party.

There are several potential roles you could take up:
- Helping [[Cooky]] prepare the meals
- Helping the teamsters [[Glunda Grapeleaf]],  [[Olf and Ulf Redfren]] look after the horses
- Gathering additional supplies and scouting ahead
- Anything relevant to your feats / background

We start now on the morning of the 4th day of travel. You have just broken camp and are on your way. You've all been assigned to the same small wagon and you are all still sat on top of it when [[Bort]] hops down from the lead wagon and jumps up to yours.
